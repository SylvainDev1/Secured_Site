# Secured_Site
React website

Code along video to practice building a site with react components. I didnt design this page, but understand all concepts behind it.

Also my first project with **react router**.
I implemented the routes differently than what is done in the video: I created a router.jsx file instead of defining routes in index.js file.
I also used a different syntax to define routing paths, to practice the way it's explained in the react online course im following.

**Features:**
- Multiple pages React site
- Added Packages: react router dom, react icons, react scroll
- Full width image background hero component
- Navbar component
